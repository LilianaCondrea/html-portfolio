    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to keep the project within scope (time, energy, resource), you can only use HTML to complete thing project. 
            Even if you know CSS and JS (which we're assuming you don't yet), you are expected to only write the website using HTML.</li>
        <li>Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. 
There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learnt how to. 
As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, the internet.</li>
